# NFT-Marketplace

A simple NFT Marketplace that allows users to **mint, list, and buy NFTs**.  
This project demonstrates the core functionality of an NFT marketplace with **minimal, human-readable smart contracts**. Frontend integration (MetaMask) is work-in-progress; interactions can be done via CLI scripts.
